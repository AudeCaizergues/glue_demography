Python scripts to clean and standardize individual-palnt phenotype data submitted by collaborators. 

Scripts need to be run in the order in which they are numbered. 

1. Split and clean individual-plant data collected by James Santangelo as part of [Santangelo _et al._ 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evl3.163)
and Marc Johnson as part of [Johnson _et al._ 2018](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2018.1019)
2. Clean and standardize individual=plant datasets submitted by collaborators
3. Replace HCN calls in collaborator datasets if they are incorrect. 

NOTE: These scripts are a convoluted mess and not in a state that can be run by anyone else. They are provided here
for posterity and transparency but shouldn't have to be run anyways; we will distribute the cleaned and standardized datasets with the
manuscript rather than the raw data.
