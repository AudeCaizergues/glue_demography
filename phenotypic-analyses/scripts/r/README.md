R scripts used to analyse environmental and phenotypic data

Only [main.R](./main.R) need to be executed by the user. Nonetheless, here is a broad description of the scripts in each subfolder. Detailed documentation can be found in each of the individual scripts in each subfolder.

- [analyses](./analyses): 4 scripts that are used in conducting the analyses presented in the paper. There include (1) Analyzing the environmental data, (2) Analyzing the phenotypic data (i.e., clines), (3) Predicting the clines from the environmental data, and (4) Predicting the clines from city characteristics (e.g., city age, size, etc.).
- [data-extraction](./data-extraction): Single script used to extract population-level % impervious surface data from GMIS rasters provided by SEDAC.
- [data-processing](./data-processing): Scripts used to summarise and clean raw data for use in downstream analyses.
- [figures-tables](./figures-tables): Scripts to generate figures and tables for main text and supplementary materials.
- [misc](./misc): Miscellaneous scripts -- functions and descriptive statistics.
