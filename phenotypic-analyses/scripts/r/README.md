R scripts used to analyse environmental and phenotypic data

Only [main.R](./main.R) need to be executed by the user. Nonetheless, here is a broad description
of the scripts in each subfolder. Detailed documentation can be found in each of the individual 
scripts in each subfolder.

[data-processing](./data-processing) contains scripts used to summarise and clean raw data
for use in downstream analyses.

[analyses](./analyses) contains 3 scripts that are used in conducting the analyses presented in the paper.
There include (1) Analyzing the environmental data, (2) Analyzing the phenotypic data (i.e., clines), and (3)
Predicting the clines from the environmental data.

[supplementary-tables](./supplementary-tables) contains small scripts used to generate supplementary tables 
to be included with the manuscripts. Example tables include summaries of environmental and phenotypic data for each city, 
etc.
