Scripts used to (1) process and clean raw data, and (2) analyze data.

[Python scripts](./python) are used exclusively for cleaning and standardizing the raw, 
individual plant datasets submitted by collaborators to ensure they are in identical formats for
downstream analyses. 

[r scripts](./r) are used for summarizing the cleaned and standardized individual plant data to generate
all manuscript results and figures that depend on the phenotypic data and the environmental data.

[shell scripts](./shell) are accessory scripts called by other programs and do not need to be directly
executed.
