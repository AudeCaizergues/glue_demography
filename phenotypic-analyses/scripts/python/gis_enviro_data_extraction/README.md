- Winter and summer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
- Winter and summer Land Surface Temperature (LST)
- Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)
- Elevation from Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
- Aridity Index (AI)

A brief explation of each script can be found in [this Excel sheet](./Python_scripts_explained.xlsx)

They are provided as is and aren't very general so might need some work to run on another machine. For a list of Landsat image IDs used for environmental
data extraction see Supplementary Tables S8 and S9
