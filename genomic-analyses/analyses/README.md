This directory contains main text and supplemental figures that were generated from the genomic data. It additionally includes summary datasets for all major analyses so that the pipeline doesn't need to be run from the raw data since this can take a long time. Metadata for all summary datasets (i.e., column names and descriptions) can ber found [HERE](./tables/metadata.xlsx), with a separate sheet for each dataset.
